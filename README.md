#  Digital Music Store Analysis 

This project is a SQL-based data analysis case study of a digital music store. It uses PostgreSQL to analyze customer behavior, sales trends, and artist performance.

##  Project Structure

├── data/                           # CSV files for each table

├── create_tables.sql     # SQL script to create all necessary tables

├── Digital Music Store Analysis.sql   # SQL queries for analysis

└── README.md

 ## Objective

To explore and analyze the digital music store data using SQL and derive insights such as:

- Best customers by spending
- Top artists and genres
- Most profitable cities and countries
- Advanced queries using CTEs and subqueries

##  Tools & Technologies

- PostgreSQL
- SQL (CTEs, JOINs, Aggregations, Window Functions)
- Excel/CSV for data input

##  How to Run

1. Clone the repository.
2. Create a PostgreSQL database (e.g., `music_store`).
3. Use the `.sql` file to create tables and run analysis queries.
4. Import the data from the CSV files inside the `data/` folder using your preferred PostgreSQL GUI (like pgAdmin) or CLI.

##  Key Learnings

- Creating and populating SQL tables
- Performing complex joins and aggregations
- Using CTEs and window functions for advanced analysis
